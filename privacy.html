							<h1><strong>Privacy</strong> policy.</h1>
							<p class="major">

								<p>The information we gather from customers enables us to personalise and improve our services and to allow our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with other users through the Website. In connection with the Website, we request and display some personal information to other users and visitors of Website, which allows users to identify each other. We collect the following types of information from our customers. </p>

The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, user name, password, email address, photograph or other likeness, purchase history, IP address, browser information and any other information you provide in connection with your user account.

The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as allowing you to interact with other users, improving the content of the Website, customising the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about and new features. </p>

								<p>Personal information collected automatically: <br>
								We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or services. Insound automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. </p>

								<p>Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components. Insound only uses this data in aggregate form, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and our Website, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal experience. Again, Insound never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally. </p>
								
								<h3>E-mail communications</h3>
								<p>We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from Insound if your computer supports this type of program. Insound uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful and improve our service. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please send your request to support@insound.com </p>

								<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognise your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. Insound cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.

								<p>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Website's most attractive features. </p>

								<p>Ads appearing on the Website may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies.

								<h3>Will Insound share any of the oersonal information it receives?</h3>
								<p>Personal Information about our customers is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We share your Personal Information only as described below. </p>

								<p>Affiliated businesses we do not control: We are affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them.

However, Insound has no control over and no liability for the use of the Fan Information by the bands. You can choose not to provide such Fan Information, but you may not be able to take advantage of the associated features. </p>
